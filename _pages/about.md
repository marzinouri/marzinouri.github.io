I am Marzia Nouri, a passionate researcher and data scientist with a focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs). As a prospective master's student, I am eager to contribute to the NLP community by developing impactful solutions..

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from [Isfahan University of Technology](https://english.iut.ac.ir/), with a thesis on question-answering systems using machine learning.

My research interests include **NLP**, **LLMs**, **interpretability**, **responsible AI**, and **low-resource language technologies**. I am also curious about exploring multimodal learning.

I am a Research Assistant at [Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI)](https://www.hbku.edu.qa/en/qcri), where I organize and structure data to improve LLM comprehension. At [HyperMatrix Lab](https://hypermatrix.cs.dal.ca/), [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca/), my work focuses on the interpretability and safety of NLP models. I also contribute to projects at the Sharif University of Technology, evaluating LLMs with an emphasis on Persian language support. In parallel, I am working as a Data Scientist at [TapSage](https://www.tapsage.com/), focusing on AI-driven solutions such as conversational AI and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. 

My research contributions have been published at [EMNLP](https://2024.emnlp.org/), [COLM](https://colmweb.org/), and [AACL](https://aclanthology.org/events/aacl-2023), focusing on interpretability of NLP models, LLM evaluation for Persian, and language technologies for under-resourced languages.

For more details, you can download my CV from the [CV page](https://marzinouri.github.io/cv/) and explore my publications on the [publications page](https://marzinouri.github.io/publications/).
